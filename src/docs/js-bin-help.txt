HTML Panel

• HTML is the display (or "view") language of the internet.
• It's what a web page is created from.
• Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) know how to render (display) HTML.
• The result shows off to the right in the "Output" panel.

JavaScript Panel

• This is where you write your CODE!
• Code is written in the JavaScript language.
• Web pages "come alive" with JavaScript.
• JavaScript is a very powerful language.

Console Panel

• Where you print stuff you don't or can't display on your web page
• Helps debug your JavaScript code
• Helps you see what variables contain just by typing their name and pressing Enter
• You can call functions on the fly from there

Output Panel

• The Output panel "renders" (displays) HTML.
• It's kind of like a mini web browser.
• You can click on buttons, etc. just like on a web page.
• When you click things it can run JavaScript (if it's written correctly).
